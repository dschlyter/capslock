Caps Lock -> Backspace mapping
==============================

Maps caps lock to backspace. This is (hopefully, YMMV) more ergonomic and saves on straining side-to-side movements for the right hand wrist.

Mac
---

Requires homebrew

    ./osx_setup.sh

Will install seil and set up the proper mappings. Open OSX keyboard preferences -> Modifier keys, and map caps lock to "No Action" after running setup script.

Windows
-------

Requires chocolatey

    win_setup.cmd

Will install autohotkey and set up the proper mappings.
